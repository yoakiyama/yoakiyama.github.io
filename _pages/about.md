I am a first year Ph.D. student in the Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science department at MIT advised by [Sergey
Ovchinnikov](https://www.solab.org/ "Solab Website"). My research focuses on building interpretable machine learning models to study
protein folding, function, regulation, and design.

Prior to starting my PhD, I was a Computational Associate in the [Getz
lab](https://getzlab.org/ "Getz Lab Website") at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard from
2020-2023. My research focused on the genetic control of protein
regulation and the dysregulation of  DNA repair in
cancer. Before joining the Getz lab, I graduated from Williams
College, where I worked with Professor Tom Murtagh to design and
implement a
log-structured file system to slow the degradation of NAND-based
SSDs.
