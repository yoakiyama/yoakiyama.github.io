I am currently an incoming MIT EECS PhD student. I am broadly
interested in developing and applying computational methods to study
protein function and regulation and their aberrations contribute to
disease development and progression.

Before starting my PhD, I was a Computational Associate in the [Getz
lab](https://getzlab.org/ "Getz Lab Website") at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard from
2020-2023. My research focused on the genetic control of protein
regulation and the dysregulation of DNA repair in
cancer. Prior to joining the Getz lab, I graduated from Williams
College, where I worked with Professor Tom Murtagh on designing a
log-structured file system for NAND memory.
